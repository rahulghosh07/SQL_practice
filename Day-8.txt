CASE EXPRESSION------------------------------------->
it goes through the conditions and returns a value when th first condition is met (like if-else).
If no condition are true then it returns the value in the else clause.
If there is no else statement and no conditions are true then it returns null.

Syntax->
	CASE
	WHEN condition1 THEN result1
	WHEN condition2 THEN result2
	WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
	ELSE other result
	END;
	
Example->
	SELECT customer_id, amount,
	CASE
	WHEN amount > 100 THEN 'Expensive product'
	WHEN amount = 100 THEN 'Moderate product'
	ELSE 'Inexpensive product'

• A common table expression, or CTE, is a temporary
named result set created from a simple SELECT statement
that can be used in a subsequent SELECT statement
Means when ever we use select operation, the result is that gets generated is temporary so setai thake CTE r modhye

• We can define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly
before SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE
statement.
	
• The WITH clause can include one or more CTEs separated
by commas

LIMIT Clause----------------->
The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples returned by
SQL.
	Example: below code will return 5 rows from the table.
		SELECT column_name FROM table_name
		LIMIT 5;
		
		SELECT Name FROM custiomer LIMIT 5;
		
		
		
ORDER Clause------------------->
Order clause is used to return the data in either ascendind order or descending order
ASC is used for Ascending order
DESC is used for descending order
	Syntax: SELECT column_name FROM table_name
			ORDER BY column_name ASC;
			
			SELECT column_name FROM table_name
			ORDER BY column_name DESC;
			
	Examle: SELECT Age FROM customer
			ORDER BY Age ASC;
			
			
To insert data from a CSV file we used COPY---------------->
	COPY customer (customer_id,first_name,last_name,email,address_id)
	FROM 'F:\customer.csv'
	DELIMETER ','
	CSV HEADER;
	
	it will copy all the data from customer.csv file which is stored in the F drive
	the datas are separated by ','.



STRING Functions in SQL---------------->
It works exactly like any other programming languages.

	Type of functions->
	i)System Defined Function->
		These are built in functions.
		rand(), round(), upper(), loweer(), count(), sum(), max() etc.
	ii)User Defined Function-> 
		 These are the functions we make or define while using.
		 
	
UPPER() converts the value to upper case
LOWER() converts the value to lower case
LENGTH() returns the length of the value
SUBSTRING() extracts a sub string from string
NOW() returns the current system date and time
FORMAT() used to set the fomat of a filed
CONCAT() adds to more strings together
REPLACE() it replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, within a new sub string
TRIM() reoves leading and trailing spaces from a string

Example: SELECT UPPER(first_name) FROM customer;
		 SELECT SUBSTRING(first_name,1,3), first_name FROM customer;//It will return 1 to 3 sub string from the strings
		 SELECT CONCAT(first_nam,last_name), first_name, last_name FROM customer;//It will return the combined result of first_name and last_name from the customer
		 SELECT REPLACE(first_name,'Mary','Mohan'), first_name FROM customer;//it will replace all the Mary with Mohan from the first_name column
		 
		 

AGGREGATE FUNCTION--------------------------->
Perfoms a calculation on multiple values and returns a single value and it is also often used with GROUP BY & SELECT STATEMENT
COUNT() returns number of values
SUM() returns sum of all values
AVG() returns average value
MAX() returns maximum value
MIN() returns minimum value
ROUND() returns a number to a specified number of decimal places

Example: SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM cusomer;
		 it means that amount has 15 rows of data

		 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
		 it means customer table has a total of 15 rows in it.
		 
		 SELECT SUM(amount) FROM customer;
		 if it returns suppose 720 means the total sum of the column is 720

		 SELCT MAX(amount) FROM customer;
		 SELECT MIN(amount) FROM customer;
		 SELECT AVG(amount) FROM customer;
		 SELECT ROUND(AVG(amount)) FROM customer;//it will round the avd value into decimal

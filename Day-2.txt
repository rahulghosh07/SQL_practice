SELECT CLAUSE--------------->

The SELECT statement is used whenever we want to some select some datas from the database.
Syntax->
	SELECT column_name from Table_name;
	
To select all the datas present in the database we use
	SELECT * from Table_name;
	
To select distinct or unique datas from database we use
	SELECT DISTINCT column_name from table_name;
	
* is known as asterix

Suppose we want to show the datas from 2 columns named ID & AGE then the code will be
	SELECT ID, AGE from classroom;
	
and if we want to se the unique values present in the column then
	SELECT DISTINCT AGE from classroom;
	

WHERE CLAUSE--------------->

The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fullfill a specified condition.
Syntax->
	SELECT column_name from table_name
	WHERE condition;
	
As an example if we want to see the record of student aged 24 only then
	SELECT NAME from classroom
	WHERE AGE=24;
	
OPERATORS------------>
The SQL reserved words meaning keywords that are prviously stored at the time of building
the language with a certain meaning to it are called operators. It is generally used alongside where clause 
for stating the condition.

i)Arithmetic Operators-> +, -,*, /, %
ii)Comparison Operators-> =, !=, >, <, >=
iii)Logical Operators-> this performs boolean operations. 
						ALL, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, AND, OR, NOT, ANY
iv)Bitwise Operators-> Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR(|)

ALL & ANY->
	ALL operator is used to select all tuples of SELECT STATEMENT. 
	It is also used to compare a value to every value in another value set 
	or result from a subquery. The ALL operator returns TRUE if all of the 
	subqueries values meet the condition.
	Column_Name = ALL (subquery); it will return true only when the result of sub query matches with the query
	Column_Name = ANY (subquery); it will return true whenever one of the result of sub query matches with the query



IN->
	SELECT * FROM Customers
	WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
	It will show all the details of these three countries
	
BETWEEN->
	used to select values within a given range.
	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
	It will show all the products of price range from 10 to 20
	
LIKE-> 
	'a%'->Finds any values that start with "a"
	'%a'->Finds any values that end with "a"
	'%or%'->Finds any values that have "or" in any position
	'_r%'->Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
	'a_%'->Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
	'a__%'->Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
	'a%o'->Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

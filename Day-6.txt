SUB QUERY------------------------------->
amra  kono query run korale je result pai tar opor amra query run korano kei sub query bole.
sub query/inner query/nested query.
it allowes us to create complex query on the output of another query.
A sub query syntax has two ELECT statements.

Syntax->
	SELECT column_name
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name operator(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition).//bracket r vitore r part ta holo sub qury.
	
Q. find the customer data whoose aamount is greater than avg value
ans.
	to find avarage value-
	SELECT avg(amount) from payment;
	
	so ans-
	SELECT * FROM payment WHERE amount>(SELECT avg(amount) drom payment);
	but whenever there are more than one values present in the column we can't use comparison 
	operator , instead we have to use IN
	
	like,
		to select customer_id,amount,mode from payment table that matches with customr_id from customer table we can write->
IN in sub query->
		SELECT customer_id,amount,mode
		FROM payment
		WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id from customer);
		
		
EXISTS in sub query->		
	Suppose we are trying to get the first_name & last_name from customer table whoose amount>100 & amount is present in 
	payment table 
	code->
		SELECT first_name,last_name
		FROM customer can
		WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT customer_id, amount
						FROM payment p
						WHERE p.customer_id=c.customer_id
						AND amount>100 );

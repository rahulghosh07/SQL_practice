x=(1,2,3) & y=(1,2,4)
inner_join(x,y)=(1,2)
left_join(x,y)=(1,2,3)
right_join(x,y)=(1,2,4)
full_join(x,y)=(1,2,3,4)

JOIN--------------------------------->
JOIN means to combine something
a join clause is used to combine data from two or more tables, based on a related 
column between then means in case inner join the common rows get selected
in case of left join the common rows and th extra rows from the left column gets selected
in case of right h=join the common rows and the extra rows from right column gets selected
in case of full join all the rows from left and right column gets selected

x=(1,2,3) & y=(1,2,4)
inner_join(x,y)=(1,2)
left_join(x,y)=(1,2,3)
right_join(x,y)=(1,2,4)
full_join(x,y)=(1,2,3,4)
left ,right, full join are parts of outer join


example: SLECT * FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN payment AS p ON c.customer_id=p.customer_id;//it will show the rows which has the same customer id for both the tables.
AS means alias here customer is replaced as c & payment is replaced as p.

	select c.first_name , p.amount,p.mode FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN payment AS p ON c.customer_id=p.customer_id;//c.first_name korar mane holo c table mane customer table r first_name column r values show korbe
	
	SELF JOIN------------------------------->
	A SELF JOIN is a regular join in which a table is joind to itself
	SELF JOIN are used for comparing values in a column of  rows within the same table
	mane ek i table different column r modhye comparison kora hoy self join use kore
	
Syntax: 
		SELECT column_name
		FROM Table AS T1
		JOIN Table AS T2
		on T1.column_name=T2.column_name;
		
		self join naturally use kora hoy kono employee r k manager existing same table r modhye
		theke determine korar jonno.
		emp_id(1,2,3,4) & emp_name(a,b,c,d) & manager_id(3,4,2,3) then that means
		c is manager of a & d
		d is manager of b
		b is manaer of c
		
		etar code-> 
		SELECT T2.empname,T1.empname FROM emp AS T1 JOIN emp AS T2 ON T1.empin=T2.manager_id;
		mane eta T2 table r empname & T1 table r empname column r value show korbe when T1 table r empin = T2 table r manager_id
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
UNION---------------------------------------->
The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine/concatenate all the columns of two tables
it operates kind of similar to full join but it has some conditions like:
To use this union clause, each SELECT statement must have 
	the same number of columns selectd and expressions
	the same data type and
	have them in the same order
	
	
Synatx->
	SELECT column_name FROM Table1
	UNION
	SELECT column_name FROM Table2;
	
Example->
	SELECT cust_name,cust_amount FROM cust1
	UNION
	SELECT cust_name,cust_amount FROM cust2;
	
	
	
UNION ALL------------------------------------------>
it is same as UNION but it includes duplucates
Synatx->
	SELECT column_name FROM Table1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT column_name FROM Table2;
